I'm learning the Arduino and markdown, and you can watch me play.  :)

### Arduinos rule

This technology has revived my love of computing.  One of the last things I did at
OpenX was host an Arduino Hackathon.

Favorite quotes
---------------

Here are some of my favorite quotes of all time.

> Free software isn't free, but expensive software is expensive.

> The great thing about standards is there are so many to choose from.

OpenX quotes
------------

During my days at OpenX we often said:

> We do it to ourselves.

> Tested in Production

Kelly even had brandy snifters printed up with "Tested in Production" etched on them.  Many lol's and toasts ensued.

Rhonda quotes
------------

My cousin Rhonda is full of amusing quotes, often with a rustic ring.

> If it was easy anybody could do it.
